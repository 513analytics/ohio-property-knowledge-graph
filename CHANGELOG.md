    decedent owner, death date, estimated heir count, occupancy status, and title
    clearance tracking
  - New `cincy:OT_HeirsProperty` ownership type in the OwnershipTypeScheme with
    references to Ohio intestate succession (ORC 2105.06) and the Uniform Partition
    of Heirs Property Act (ORC 5307.20 et seq., effective April 6, 2023)
  - 2 new validation tests for heirs' property class and ownership type

    DTE form tracking (`cincy:dteFormNumber`), transfer type classification
    (`cincy:transferType`), and mortgage financing link (`cincy:financedBy`)
  - New `cincy:Mortgage` class modeling recorded liens on parcels — Ohio is a lien theory
    state (ORC Chapter 5301). Properties include amount, dates, interest rate, term,
    type, payment structure, open-end mortgage support (ORC 5301.232), satisfaction
    tracking (ORC 5301.36), and lien priority
  - New `cincy:OwnershipInterest` class modeling how parties hold title — Ohio-specific
    forms including survivorship tenancy (ORC 5302.20), tenancy in common (default),
    life estate with remainder, trust ownership, and TOD designation (ORC 5302.22).
    Note: Ohio does NOT recognize tenancy by the entireties or community property
- Transfer-related SKOS vocabularies (`ontology/cincy-transfer-vocab.ttl`)
  - `cincy:TransferClassificationScheme` with 5 top-level categories and 18 transfer
    types covering market sales, court-ordered/involuntary, family/estate, entity,
    and government transfers
  - `cincy:MortgageTypeScheme` with 4 top-level categories and 14 mortgage types
    covering conventional, government-backed (FHA, VA, USDA), Ohio state programs
    (OHFA first-time homebuyer, Ohio Heroes, down payment assistance), and special
    purpose (reverse, HELOC, construction, land contract)
  - `cincy:PaymentStructureScheme` with 5 payment structures: fixed fully amortizing,
    adjustable rate (ARM), balloon, interest-only, and graduated payment
  - `cincy:OwnershipTypeScheme` with 6 Ohio-specific ownership types: sole, survivorship
    tenancy, tenancy in common, life estate, trust, and TOD designation
- 4 new example SPARQL queries:
  - `transfer-history.rq` — ownership chain and transaction history for a parcel
  - `mortgage-lookup.rq` — financing history and current liens on a property
  - `ownership-interests.rq` — co-ownership patterns and life estate arrangements
  - `foreclosure-transfers.rq` — foreclosure activity analysis by date range
- 17 new SPARQL validation tests for transfer, mortgage, and ownership classes and vocabularies
- Glossary entries for 15+ new terms: arm's length transaction, balloon payment,
  conveyance fee, deed, DTE Form 100, foreclosure, life estate, lien priority,
  lien theory, mortgage, OHFA, open-end mortgage, ownership interest, purchase money
  mortgage, survivorship tenancy, tenancy in common, transfer on death
- New abbreviations: FHA, HCLRC, HECM, HELOC, OHFA, TOD, USDA, VA
  - `db_to_rdf.py` — main script. Uses a Postgres server-side cursor to stream
    rows in configurable batches and writes triples directly to the output
    stream, keeping client-side memory flat regardless of result-set size.
  - `mapping.example.yaml` — example mapping showing how to convert parcels,
    owners, postal addresses, and the relationships between them into
    `cincy:` ontology triples using `SELECT DISTINCT` per entity class.
  - `pyproject.toml` — project metadata and dependencies. Install with
    `uv sync` (recommended) or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - `requirements.txt` — pinned `psycopg[binary]` and `PyYAML` dependencies.
  - `README.md` — usage, mapping-file format reference, and tuning notes.
